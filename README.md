# 📊 Time Series Forecasting System with ARIMA, ANN, and Hybrid Models

This project implements a **complete forecasting system** that models and compares time series forecasting techniques across the **Finance**, **Energy**, and **Environmental** sectors. It includes a fully integrated web application with interactive visualizations and model evaluation features.
## 📌 Overview

This web-based forecasting system allows users to:
- Explore and preprocess sector-specific time series data
- Select and compare various forecasting models
- Visualize predictions, residuals, and accuracy metrics interactively
- Upload new datasets and retrain models in real-time
